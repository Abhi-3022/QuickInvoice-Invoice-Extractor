# QuickInvoice-Invoice-Extractor

QuickInvoice-Invoice-Extractor is a Streamlit-based application designed to analyze invoices in multiple languages by processing image uploads of invoice documents. Leveraging Google’s Gemini model, the application extracts and interprets data from invoice images, allowing users to ask questions about the content of the uploaded invoices. The tool processes uploaded images, extracting text information and providing detailed responses based on the user’s query.

# Project Purpose
The aim of this tool is to simplify the invoice-reading process, especially for multilingual invoices, by enabling quick extraction and comprehension of key information. This is particularly useful for accounting teams, auditors, or business owners handling diverse invoice formats and languages.
